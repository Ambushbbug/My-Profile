            <p> ✮ Hello, dear comrade! I'm Lena, also known as Lee. I'm 18 years old and currently a first-year student
                in the International track at EMLV Business School, located in La Défense, Paris. La Défense is Europe's
                largest business district, but let's not dwell on that too much (¬‿¬).
                <br>✮ To give a quick description of myself, I am what people refer to as an ambivert, meaning I am a
                combination of extrovert and introvert tendencies, although I lean more towards being introverted.
                According to the MBTI, my type is INTP, and despite not appearing or sounding like one, I truly am! I
                blow candles on my cake every 28th of February.
                <br>✮ As an introvert, I enjoy indoor activities such as playing video games, watching anime, reading
                novels and manga, and taking naps (my favorite). Regarding my personality, I can describe myself as
                someone who appreciates solitude. I find comfort in being alone in my own world, as it serves as my
                comfort zone.
            </p>

            <h2 id="passions">˚₊‧꒰ა Passions ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
            <p> ➪ Passions are the driving forces that give life its color and meaning. They are the activities and
                interests that bring us joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose. <br>
            <h3>⋆˚✿˖° Dance ⋆˚✿˖°</h3>
            <p> One of my greatest passions is dance. Whether it's ballet, hip-hop, or contemporary, the art of movement
                captivates me. Dance allows me to express myself creatively and release my emotions. The discipline,
                dedication, and physicality required in dance have taught me valuable life lessons, such as
                perseverance, teamwork, and self-expression. I was born in Island, where dance is deeply ingrained in
                the culture. My mom has always been supportive, especially when it comes to cultural activities,
                particularly dance. I have learned various dance styles from different cultures and countries, but my
                favorites are street dance, belly dance and his variants from Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic regions.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>♫₊˚. Music ✩｡</h3>
            <p>Another passion of mine is music. Since a young age, I have been captivated by the impact of melodies and
                lyrics. Whether I am playing an instrument or simply listening to my favorite songs, music has the power
                to evoke various emotions and transport me to different places. It serves as a therapeutic outlet,
                offering comfort and solace during difficult times. I appreciate all styles of music(except french rap
                or just french songs in general), and even attended music school, where I developed a love for playing
                the drums and xylophone.</p><br>
            <h3>𓆩 Technology 𓆪</h3>
            <p>My passion for technology is evident in my love for coding and web development. I even studied it for two
                years in school. The world of CSS, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript fascinates me. It allows me to create and
                bring ideas to life on the digital canvas. The constant evolution of technology challenges me to stay
                updated and adapt to new trends. It also opens doors to endless possibilities and career opportunities
                in the ever-expanding digital landscape. I have recently started learning Angular, which is pretty
                interesting.</p><br>
            <h3>˗ˏˋ Sports ˎˊ˗</h3>
            <p>Another passion of mine is sports. I enjoy the adrenaline rush and physical challenge that comes with
                engaging in various sports activities. Sports not only keep me fit and healthy but also teach me
                important values such as discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. Whether I'm on the field or court, it
                brings me a sense of joy and accomplishment.</p><br>I have a background in athletics and handball,
            having participated in both for three years. Additionally, I used to play tennis when I was a kid. Although
            I am no longer actively involved in competitive sports, I continue to stay active as a gym member.<br>
            <h3>❦.ʚ Video games ɞ.❦</h3>
            <p>Video games are one of my greatest passions. I find joy and excitement in exploring virtual worlds,
                solving puzzles, and immersing myself in captivating storytelling. From action-packed adventures to
                strategic simulations, video games provide endless entertainment and a means of connecting with others
                through online multiplayer experiences. They have also sparked my interest in game development and
                design, inspiring me to learn more about the art and technology behind creating interactive experiences.
            </p><br>
            <h3>.𖥔 ݁ ˖ Geek culture .𖥔 ݁ ˖</h3>
            <p>Geek culture is another one of my passions. It encompasses a wide range of interests, from comic books
                and superheroes to science fiction and fantasy. I love diving into the intricate worlds and narratives
                created in these mediums. Exploring the vast universes of Marvel and DC comics, getting lost in the
                pages of epic fantasy novels, and indulging in the imaginative realms of anime and manga are all a part
                of my geek culture passion. It's a world that allows me to embrace my creativity and connect with
                like-minded individuals who share the same enthusiasm for these geeky pursuits.</p>
